# Simple Mesh Scattering

This simple package will allow you to place one mesh on another with some options:
- spawning on vetices/faces
- changing density
- changing scale
- randomizing scale
- rolling for options with seed
- baking spawned objects into one
- meshes are alligned using source mesh normal
<a/>

Does not allow placement by hand but instead offers utility similar to Unity's Terrain - Mass Place Trees but instead with support for non terrain meshes.
